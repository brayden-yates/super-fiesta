## A complete and utter pile of garbage

Welcome to my humble home! I have made this site available to share my perspectives and viewpoints on 
various things that interest me. If they interest you as well, feel free to reach out! If they don't 
interest you...bummer. 

You'll notice this site does not use any framework. No javascript, no bootstrap, no fancy landing pages. 
I've dabbled with these frameworks, and they are all trash. Seriously, why do plumbers have any need for 
a fancy landing page with all the bells and whistles. If I were making the decision between two plumbers:
one with a fancy wordpress site and another with a site that looks like [Heaven's Gate](https://heavensgate.com),
plumber #2 is my guy.

## Title case is fucking stupid

Title case is seriously stupid. Sentence case reigns supreme and I will die on that hill. There is absolutely 
no reason to capitalize every major word in a sentence. Aesthetically, sentence case looks much more trimmed 
and refined. Just look at the title of this section. Try to *inspect element* and compare. You'll see 
exactly what I'm talking about. Proper nouns? Sure. First letter of the sentence? Definitely. Verbs, adverbs, 
and adjectives? What the hell is wrong with you?! 

This is my ["eat your cake and have it too"](http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002762.html) 
and I know that. Violence and/or crime is not of any interest to me, so I think I should be fine. Please consider
adjusting your titles in your personal website to join what is currently a one-man grammatical movement.

## About me

I am allegedly a human being living on Planet Earth, Sol System, Milky Way Galaxy, Virgo Supercluster. I was born around 13.7
billion years after the Big Bang, and approximately 1.7 Ã— 10<sup>106</sup> years before the Heat Death of the Universe. 
I have a Bachelor's degree in something or another and I may-or-may not have a Master's degree. I work for an employer as an employee
doing tasks that increase the profits of said company. At the time of writing this, I was able to generate uuid 
`83e8847f-9797-4ed8-9a18-6911b185bc59`.

I think that work is an important part of our daily lives, and I intend to work in some capacity well after I reach retirement age.
Retirement seems to, in many cases, increase decay and shorten lifespans. I do not have a citation for this, and I do not intend on
looking for one. You can do your own research and tell me if I'm right or wrong. I really don't care. I think what I think.

In my free time, I enjoy playing Devil's Advocate, writing piss-poor code, and watching films. I think we should utilze hyphens more
frequently. I think privacy is a right, and I wish hopelessly to a return to the style of webrings and internet popular in the 90s.

## Hardware and software

- **Computers**: Framework laptop and a self-built desktop
- **Operating system**: Arch linux. Yes, I did install this with archinstall.
- **Desktop environment**: KDE Plasma. Sue me.
- **Text editor**: Neovim
- **Terminal**: zsh. I love terminal completion.

## Contact me

Feel free to reach out to me. My email is human [at] yatesrelates [dot] com. You can also find my public key [here](gpg.txt).

Please keep in mind that I prefer communicating using GPG. If you do choose to write me, please send me your public key with your first email. 

## Use the tools I wrote

I am the developer of a simple little terminal tool called podget. Like all good software, it does one thing and one thing only. In this case, that is downloading the entire library of a podcast from an RSS feed. It's meant for data hoarders, but feel free to use it even if you aren't the type to hoard media. Contribute to it, use it, fork it, do whatever! Podget can be found [here](https://github.com/brayden-yates/podget).
